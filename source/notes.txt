Final Project - RC4
May 31, 2022

Outline/Notes:
--------------
Key-scheduling algorithm (KSA):
Used to generate a permutation of S, the sequence of all 256 bytes

Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA):
Used to output bytes in keycipher

Homework Assignment:
--------------------
* Give keys generated by RC4. Make students do language processing to see how there is less of a randomized selection of letters with RC4, which is why it was considered vulnerable.

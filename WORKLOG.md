#### 5/19
**Jerry:** Created file structure and testing main method. Wrote encoder (matches expected output), fixed small bug with PRGA (number of iterations).

**Deven:** Added XOR function, needs tweaking for comparing plaintext and RGA specified values. Ciphertext produced in byte string.

#### 5/20
**Jerry:** Commented out extraneous code. Wrote decoder method. Created new encode method that takes file arguments and returns file output (needs to be tested).

**Deven:** LOREM IPSUM

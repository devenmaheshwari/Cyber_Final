# Worklog
Stuyvesant Cybersecurity 2022: Final Project

Deven Maheshwari & Jerry Liang

## Log

#### 5/19
**Jerry:** Created file structure and testing main method. Wrote encoder (matches expected output), fixed small bug with PRGA (number of iterations).

**Deven:** Added XOR function, needs tweaking for comparing plaintext and RGA specified values. Ciphertext produced in byte string.

#### 5/20
**Jerry:** Commented out extraneous code. Wrote decoder method. Created new encode method that takes file arguments and returns file output (needs to be tested).

#### 5/21
**Deven:** Added basic commenting. Also included decoder file method in decoder.py. Will test next 
session. 

#### 5/23/
**Deven:** Notes for all functions within encoding. Ran into type errors while testing, looked at byte
types for arrays.

# Cyber_Final
Stuyvesant Cybersecurity 2022: Final Project <br>
Deven Maheshwari & Jerry Liang

## Description
We will be tackling the RC4 (Rivest Cipher) stream cipher. This is known for its speed and security. We will be writing an encoder and decoder. It functions by using random a key scheduling algorithm and a random generation algorithm as well as the XOR function to produce cipher-text.
